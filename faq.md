## **Is it safe to keep our money in your wallet?**

Absolutely. Customer funds are stored in an offline cold wallet, which is protected from cyber attacks.

Operational, or “hot” wallet, holds funds required for automated operations, such as multiple payments to your clients. This wallet holds the CoinsPaid operational funds. So we have you covered.

Prior to integration, the operator decides how much money he wants to keep in our system, thereby setting storage limits. All funds exceeding these limits \(bankroll\) will be automatically transferred to the operator's external address.
