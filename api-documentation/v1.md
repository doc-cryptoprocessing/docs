# V1

## General information

Api endpoint for all requests is:

```text
https://app.coinspaid.com/api/v1
```

#### Deposit flow

1. You obtain new address from CoinsPaid API \(for some currencies it may be address and tag\) and store it somewhere on your side. After that you show this address to your customer in order to make a deposit.
2. Customer sends some funds to this address.
3. When transaction is sent by a customer - CoinsPaid sends a callback to your callback url with transaction details. It contains status, address, currency, amount and fees.  If status is successful, you should deposit respective amount to customer balance on your side.

#### Withdrawal flow

1. You request to send amount of money to address.
2. Your request is validated on our side. If signature is correct, address is valid and you have enough balance - CoinsPaid responds you with the transaction object.
3. You will receive a callback when transaction status is updated.

Foreign\_id is used to identify the withdrawal. Foreign\_id is a unique string that you send to CoinsPaid to avoid network issues and double sending of funds, and used to identify your requests.   
Common approach is to insert transaction record to your MySQL or any other relational database before calling withdrawal API, and send to CoinsPaid id from autoincrement field in your database.

To provide authentication for the callback, coinspaid API signs the POST your api key and secret:

1. **X-Processing-Key** – Your public key
2. **X-Processing-Signature** – POST body, signed by the your secret key HMAC-SHA512

{% hint style="info" %}
**Read this if you accept tokens.**  
Please pay attention to having 2 currency fields - "currency" and "currency\_fee".   
For USDT or ERC20 tokens "**currency**" will be USDT or \*TOKENNAME\* and **"currency\_fee"** will be BTC or ETC / ETH, because in USDT blockchain fees are paid in BTC and in ERC20 fees paid by ETC / ETH respectively.
{% endhint %}
